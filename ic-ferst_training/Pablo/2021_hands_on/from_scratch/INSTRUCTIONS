1) Generate a rectangle model using gmsh
2) Impose initial conditions and BCs to generate a multiphase porous media model/inertia one (with a passive tracer) or two components. Outlet and inlet Pressure BC
2.1) For inertia slip BCs up and down
2.2) Use show convergence
3) Change mesh resolution and see its effect
4) Vary time-step and see its effect
5) Disable the non-linear solver settings (instead of -10 use 1)
6) Adapt time-step absed on PID for porous media
7) For inertia, adapt time-step based on CFL
8) Include DMO. Test different gradation parameters, maximum and minimum element size and frequency of adapts
9) Include temperature for porous media
10) Optional Include concentration (single phase) and Boussinesq EOS (and SP solver)
